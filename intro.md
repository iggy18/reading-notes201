# A Brief Oververview of What We Will Cover.

## HTML
- HTML uses elements to describe the structure of pages
- A basic HTML file includes a head, title, and body.
- There are diferent versions of HTML; HMTL 4, XHTML 1.0, and HTML 5.
- a <!doctype> tag is used to tell the browser which version of HTML you're using.

## HTML 5 introduced a new set of elements that define the structure of a page.

1. *header* top of page.
2. *footer* bottom of page.
3. *nav* navigation bar.
4. *article* content that could stand alone.
5. *aside* links to related content down the side of the page.
6. *section* groups related content together.
7. *hgroup* group together a set of one or more h1-h6 elements.
8. *figure* used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article.
9. *div* used to group related elements together.

## Process and design.

### to design a website you must consider 5 things
1. who is the site for?
2. why people visit the site?
3. what are visitors trying to achieve?
4. what information do visitors need?
5. how often will people visit your site?

- the process of designing a site starts with a site map. its a bunch of little boxes all linked together by topic.
- then you move on to a wireframe, which is like a rough sketch of the sites layout.
- lastly, you dress the site up using aesthetically pleasing colors, shapes, and themes.

## once you have the content of your site you add functionality with JavaScript.

- a script is a seris of intructions that a computer can follow to achiev a goal.
- before you write a scrript you want to plan it out by defining the goal, designing the script, and then coding each step.
- you can use flowcharts and lists to help you design the script
- coputers create models of the world using data. 
- **objects** are things, **properties** are charicteristics, **events** can change the values of properties in the objects, and **methods** represent things people need to do with the objects.

## How do HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fit together.

1. ***HTML*** is the content layer
2. ***CSS is the*** presentation layer
3. ***JavaScript is*** the behavioral layer.
