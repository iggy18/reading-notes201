## Images

- storing images on your site.

- add images with the `<img>` tag.
- `src` tells thew browser where it can find the image file.
- `alt` provides a text description of the image if you can not see it.
- `title` displays title when mouse hovers over image.
- you can specify `height` and `width` in an `<img>` tag.
- `align = "left"` will place an image to the left of a page. *old code*

- three rules for creating images
1. save images in jpeg, gif, or png.
2. save images at the size they will apear on the website.
3. measure in pixels

- PNG images can have a transparent background.
- `<figure>` adds a caption that explains the image.
