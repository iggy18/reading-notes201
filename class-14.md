## what google learned from trying to make the perfect team.

- project aristotle
- google studied hundreds of it's team to figure out why some tumbled and others soared.
- it was almost impossible to find strong patterns in the data among groups
- undestanding group norms is the key to improving teams. 
- the right norms raise a groups collective intellegence.
- equal speaking seems to lead to a productive group.
- google found that psycological safety seems to be the most important thing foro a productive team.

## CSS transforms
-  ***2-d transforms***
- Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axis, known as horizontal and vertical axis.
- `rotate` - rotates from 0 to 360 degrees
- `scale` - change size of an element above 1 make it bigger, less than one makes it smaller.
- `translate` - moving in different directions without interupting the flow of the document. good for moving things without disturbing the document!!!!!!!!
- `skew` - distort elements on horizontal of verticle axis.

- 3-d transforms
- are mostly the same as 2-d transforms but include a z-axis.

## transitions
- transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.
- transistion occur on these pseudo-classes :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.
- transition-property -  determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties
- transition-duration -  set using general timing values
- transition-timing-  used to set the speed in which a transition will move
- transition-delay - sets a time value, seconds or milliseconds, that determines how long a transition should be stalled before executing

## animations
- To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.
- to use an animation youll have to use the name, duration, timing funtion, and delay of the animation.
- To have an animation repeat itself numerous times the `animation-iteration-count` property may be used
