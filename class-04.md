# class 4 reading notes.

## links
- links allow you to move from one page to another enabling the very idea of surfing the web.
- `href` specifys which page you want to link to.
- linking to a different website requires the aboslute URL.
- linking other pages on the same site can use a reletive url.
- email links use `mailto:` example `<a href="mailto:noone@noone.com`
- open links in new wondow by using `target="_blank"` ex `<a href="http://www.lol.com" target" _blank'>`

## layout
- css treats each HTML element as if it is in it's own box. it is either block level or inline.
- if you have a box in a box the outer box is know as the **parent**
- position: reletive moves an elemet from where it would be in normal flow.
- position: absolute positions element in relation to its parent.
- position:fixed positions element in relation to browser window.
- float allows you to to position element to far left or right.
- float can place elements side by side.

- most designers try to create pages around 960-1000 pixels wide so the site is viewable on most screens.
- fixed width layouts do not change size with browser window. tend to use pixels.
- liquid layouts stretch and contract as user changes browser size. tend to use percentages.

- grid layouts help a designer copose the elements of a website.
- CSS - frameworks make like easier by providing the code for common tasks.
- there can be multiple CSS files in one page.

## functions, methods, and objects
- fuctions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. functions can be reused.
- declaring a function: `function nameit() {code it;}` 
- calling a function `nameit();`
- sometimes fuctions need more info. when you declai the function give it perameters.
- `function getarea(width, height) {return width *height; }`
- calling functions that need info
- `getarea(3, 5);`
- getting a single value out of a function. some functions return infromation to the code that called them.
- fuctions can return more than one value using an array.
- variable scope - the location you declair a vairable will affect where it can be used in your code.
- global variables are declaired outside of a function and can be used anywhere within the script. 
- local variables are declared within a function and can only be used in that function.
- global variables use more memory and make a page slower, local variables use less memory and make the make run smoother.

## six reasons for pair programing.
- pair programing is a two heads are better than one approach to programing.
- driver and navigator
- the driver types code, manages version control, uses the text editor, switching files, and writing code.
- the navigator uses words to guide the driver but does not input anything into the computer. the navigator does the thinking and planning.
- pair programming helps you learn by hearing, speaking, writing, and understanding concepts when sharing them with another person.
- pair programing increases efficiency. with two people working on the same code quality is higher and often requires less troubleshooting.
- pair programing increases engagement. its more exciting and less easy to procrastinate.
- everyone has a different approach to programming. working in pairs allows you to learn from peers.
- improves social skills.
- a common step in interviews is programing with a current employee. pair programing in codefellows increases interview AND job readyness.
